    <h1>The current State and Status of Theory in Psychological Science</h1>
  <p class="muted small">
  <b>About this survey.</b> Psychological science has repeatedly diagnosed persistent problems with theory:
  many theories remain verbal and underspecified, hypotheses are often not derived from theory, and empirical
  findings do not consistently constrain or refine theoretical claims. A full, detailed statement of this
  position—together with its background and rationale—is available as an OSF preprint:
  <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/2fjx4_v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/2fjx4_v2</a>.
</p>

<p class="muted small">
  <b>Where the items come from.</b> The questions in this survey are taken directly from two summary tables in
  the preprint. Table 1 lists diagnostic claims about the current state of theorizing and theory development
  in psychological science (e.g., how theories are specified, how often hypotheses are derived from theory, and
  how empirical results feed back into theory). Table 2 lists downstream consequences that may follow when
  theory development is limited (e.g., limited cumulative progress, difficulty interpreting results, and weak
  guidance for application).
</p>

<p class="muted small">
  <b>What we ask you to do.</b> For each item, you will provide two ratings: (1) the extent to which you agree
  the item is accurate in your subfield at present, and (2) the extent to which the item represents a serious
  problem (Table 1) or a serious cause (Table 2). The survey is designed to be brief and should take only a few
  minutes.
</p>

<p class="muted small">
  <b>Anonymity.</b> We do not ask for names, email addresses, or other direct identifiers; please do not enter
  identifying information anywhere in your responses.
</p>

<p class="muted small">
  <b>Purpose and use of the data.</b> This survey is intended as an annual “sentiment barometer” for the field.
  We will use the results to (i) summarize current levels of agreement and perceived severity across items,
  (ii) identify where views are consensual versus contested, and (iii) track changes over time across yearly
  waves. Results may be reported in aggregate (e.g., means/distributions by item and year, possibly stratified
  by broad subfield or career stage when sample sizes allow). We do not aim to evaluate individual respondents.
</p>

<p class="muted small">
  <b>Public availability.</b> A de-identified dataset of responses (and the survey materials/code) will be made
  publicly available after collection (e.g., via OSF/GitHub) to support transparency and year-to-year comparison.
